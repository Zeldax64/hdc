 madam president  agree and recognise turkeys european prospects but if these prospects are to have an auspicious outcome turkey needs to 
 madam president firstly  would like to express my sincerest thanks to the high representative for including this important issue in the agenda at such an early stage 
 mr president the treaty of lisbon will radically reform the budgetary procedure of the european union 
 madam president one of the priorities of the council presidency is to increase the influence of the  on the international stage and more specifically in latin america 
 mr president commissioner ladies and gentleman  welcome the opportunity to tackle with all necessary urgency the discussion on measures to be adopted to safeguard stocks of bluefin tuna and the gradual reduction of quotas established by the  
 lithuania is a country that made a commitment in its accession agreement to adopt the euro 
 when they joined the european union some central and eastern european countries made commitments in the accession treaties commitments which were difficult both politically and economically to decommission nuclear power plants and ensure the safe handling of nuclear waste 
 as coordinator for regional policy in the  group  am happy with the position regions and cities will occupy in the implementation of the lisbon strategy 
 given that president buzeks explanations about the voting procedure were confusing and contradictory and that some voting machines failed to work  think that repeating the vote would provide transparency and a legitimate result 
 dear colleagues it saddens me very much that the situation concerning democracy human rights and the rule of law has not been improving in belarus 
the sitting was closed at  pm 
  this text must enter into force as soon as possible 
 balanced approach is needed here 
 constructive response to it from the european union is overdue and necessary 
 difference of only   confirms that there is a broad convergence of views with regard to the  community budget 
 different approach which can be seen in the amendments put forward by the left would be a demonstration of selfishness hypocrisy and shortsightedness 
 few of the amendments aim to clarify the obligations on public authorities in relation to public access and data selling and to provide safeguards for data providers in relation to intellectual property rights 
 number of things about this debate are bothering me  this is almost a problem of mentality  for example that it is not permitted to mention facts in case this is taken as a criticism or misinterpreted in turkey 
 sense of moderation will have to be observed when determining their pension benefits 
 transparent international investigation into the assassination of mrs bhutto the full restoration of freedom of the press and free and fair elections in pakistan are also an essential issue for the european union 
above all we must use this presidency to clarify guidelines particularly those on europe s longterm immigration policy 
according to jo becker of human rights watch the increase in abductions is dramatic and alarming 
according to the treaties this should be formed at the national level but the stability of the common currency  the euro  and growth in the competitiveness of the entire european union is dependent on its successful implementation 
according to the findings of the court of auditors as many as  files were opened over the past year though in a good few instances two or three of them related to one and the same case 
according to the latest reports this prisoner is said because of his faith to be in a prison hospital in the town of mary where he is being administered highly infectious and tranquillising injections 
adjournment of the session 
after the  enlargement to central and eastern european countries the  has understandably refocused the  towards the east ie russia central asia and china but nevertheless trade between latin america and the  continues to grow rapidly 
again of course no 
agricultural and funding reform should not be tied up directly with enlargement on the other hand of course as we well know the present and future members of the  should be able to agree at the copenhagen summit in december on at least some of the principles for future agricultural and funding reform which as we know will be necessary from  
all confirmed the same impression unfortunately the  has responsibilities in africa and this is why we have adopted this resolution today 
all credit as well to mrs ucas report which looks in greater depth at and grasps the aspects that the commission has not taken into account which  think the commission should accept 
all of which confirms as  have already said that this social democratic europe may well be capable of winning elections but is not yet proving capable of leading the continent 
all that time  was doing extremely useful work under extraordinarily difficult circumstances 
also when we talk about the major difficult issue of immigration europe cannot fail to hear the cry of pain uttered by millions and millions of africans 
although the free movement of labour is a fundamental principle of european integration  member states still maintain barriers against romanian and bulgarian citizens 
although we know that the majority of these societies do sound work they must no longer be permitted to be slipshod in what they do 
amendment no  which emphasises the multifunctional role of forests is also welcome in my view 
amendment no  now makes further changes 
amendment no  in my view is already covered by the existing directive and merely repeats the provisions of article  
an essential condition in order to make good progress in the work in this respect is that the cooperation with member states and the industry and with other partners be as fruitful as possible 
an honest appraisal in the aftermath of bali compels us to analyse the conference as follows first of all the international panel on climate change managed to convince much of global public opinion with its climate scenarios but was by no means as convincing on the conclusions to be drawn from the present situation secondly while europe forges ahead on its own there is scarcely any sign of willingness among the international community to enter into binding agreements on  reductions 
an interim report of the weil group in november  focussed on an approach which offered at least a start to the solving of some of these difficulties 
and  would like to add that it is my personal belief that we will need to choose a form which gives parliament a reasonable amount of influence in this very sensitive and important area 
and finally as a european  once again call upon the commission and the council to make certain that the social clauses are put in place 
and he is right of course 
and it is on that point that  differ somewhat 
and your final question asks what specific measures the commission intends to propose to make sure that  migration does not lead to a more expensive payment system 
and if there is a special offer another two prices again 
another is that by changing the status of sectors do we not distort the existing market 
another matter is that we have been deregulating the telecommunications industry for around ten years and now with these massive internet players merging there is a fear that they will once again start regulating the market 
another positive outcome from the negotiations was that the strict export restrictions of some countries such as sweden and germany have not been eroded 
another problem is the definition of drug addicts as patients 
another suggestion which  have advocated for a long time is to invest in developing the rail sector which is an undoubtedly safer form of transport than road transport and which could provide a truly sustainable alternative to a road sector which is increasingly saturated 
any arrangements must be introduced within the framework of the  and the  which should play an essential role in international shipping without accepting the philosophy of compromise with shipping interests 
anybody can point matters out and if there are any problems they will be corrected 
anyone preparing to design a machine thinks of the whole machine which is bought because it is attractive as a whole not for an individual part which is not beautiful enough on its own 
apparently the gate was open too wide 
articles  and  of the proposal concern access to information and reporting 
as member for toulouse  can tell you how much two years after the event the tragedy of the explosion at the  factory remains extraordinarily present in the town in the minds and often even in the flesh of the victims of the disaster 
as mr alain richard french minister of defence has already pointed out he has every intention of addressing the european parliament on as yet unspecified dates 
as socialists our priorities include consumer protection the defence of quality is one way of protecting these rights 
as a french citizen  was moved as  was when germany was buffeted by storms and there were also those disasters in the azores  
as a result of this hundreds of scottish boats have had to be scrapped and fishing communities have suffered 
as always mr verheugen came out against the progressive trio of commissioner piebalgs commissioner dimas and commissioner kroes 
as an outside observer allow me to reiterate what  said earlier to mrs gonzalez 
as draftsman of the opinion of the committee on foreign affairs humans rights common security and defence policy on the report on nuclear sector related activities for the applicant countries of central and eastern europe and the new independent states unanimously adopted on  october last year  stressed the crucial importance of safety defining it as a requirement for accession for new member states of the union 
as far as food and agricultural production are concerned we must have a deep respect for people s clear right to information about the food they eat 
as far as whether our rights have been expanded or reduced ladies and gentlemen please read the report and look at the legislation 
as for the fourth point commissioner  believe that we need to discuss it seriously it concerns the structural policy and the lisbon strategy 
as for the new demands that have arisen with the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon we support excellence in lawmaking and the demand for adequate resources to achieve this objective 
as he said we shall hold a sitting specifically devoted to this subject within the convention on  and  february 
as huge sums of money are involved in major sports common rules and regulations should be drawn up to take account of the system s basic pillars sportsmen and the organisers of sporting events 
as in this compromise  naturally wish to highlight the importance of not interfering with the directive on the posting of workers 
as much as  of farmers total direct payments would be clawed back and transferred to some rural development measures or returned back into the  budget itself 
as previous speakers on this issue have indicated the individual member states have not implemented the criteria properly 
as regards the two amendments within the framework of the second reading they clearly improve the quality of the text and the commission can therefore accept them in full 
as regards timing my advice would be that it is premature to talk about timetables at this stage we should not take the second step before the first 
as regards your third question on the weakening of the principle of additionality additionality is one of the basic principles of cohesion policy 
as the international community finally woke up to indonesia s oppression the idea that freedom was on its way grew in their minds 
as the questions say the board of the  recently approved revised transport regulations including specifications for air transport applicable to all radioactive materials 
as the report states there are also problems in reconciling work and family life that are relevant to equality between women and men in professional life 
as you know these treaties deal with all categories of income aimed to eliminate dual taxation bilaterally harmonizing effective taxation rates at source and in the place of residence and avoiding tax invasion 
at porto alegre in the face of the discredited image of europe that the united states wants to disseminate everywhere another europe was also discussed a europe about whose shortcomings we have no illusions but which many envy us a europe that is a model of successful integration 
at least that is what this report is saying and  think that makes sense 
at present this region is full of memories 
at the beginning of march the council adopted conclusions that set up the broad political mandate and the main priorities for the  at these meetings 
at the centre of this whole newlyignited dispute the disagreements we have and the european crisis is a single sentence uttered by founding father of the european union jean monnet who said we are not uniting states we are uniting people 
at the heart of this is the destabilising attempt to make the courts subservient to the executive something we witness the italian government doing on a daily basis by means unworthy of a civil state 
at the heart of this struggle in which colombia is a leading player are the social question and the countrys location 
at the moment however we are witness to a more gradual approach 
at the moment its most famous citizen is mohammad junus who received the nobel peace prize this year for his contribution to the fight against poverty by means of a system of microcredits 
at the same time however you cannot rewrite history 
at the same time we are willing to consider these issues in a broader context 
at the time jacques delors the  government and all the european leaders condemned these people for daring to rise up against communist and federalist regimes 
at this juncture these are all the feasible and practical undertakings we can give to try and resolve an appalling and longlasting bloody situation 
at this point  would like to remind you of the debate we had two years ago regarding turkeys accession 
because of the common position on burma it was impossible to invite the burmese delegation to the  ministerial meeting in berlin which led to that meeting being cancelled 
because this is a communication that achieved the broad consensus of the various parties involved  should like to reiterate my support for the commissions conclusions and for the aims proposed for developing practical policies to achieve active ageing and the involvement of all interested parties in defining policies in the field of social protection inclusion and employment 
before  move on to the question of the approach agreed upon in the council  would like to remind everyone of the timely and effective work instigated by the commission and given the support of the member states standing veterinary committee to implement vital crisis measures imposed by the precautionary principle 
before there can be any further talk about amending the ecisrael association agreement  would like to call upon the commission as a matter of urgency to resolve this situation before the end of its term of office 
before we are too congratulatory  would however draw attention to the problem of the code of good administrative behaviour 
being responsible for monitoring the process the commission must be granted powers to impose sanctions in the event of noncompliance 
better focused state aid means better economic results and governance and ultimately better and more secure jobs and better use of taxpayers money 
bizarrely mr lukashenko may even have had sufficient popular support   to   to have won the vote in a free election 
both our rapporteurs mrs theato and mr bontempi have also already made this clear and  congratulate them on their work 
both the  and the  need an efficient institutional framework but that will not be enough it must have political content added to it 
but  am sure  and  say this quite openly  that these difficult negotiations can ultimately be resolved as everything can that stands between people who have a certain talent for reason even if they are pursuing different interests 
but  must say that at present  do not see any justification for introducing export refunds in the pig meat sector because we see that the number of pregnant sows and the number of piglets are decreasing 
but as far as my group is concerned the rule is what is illegal offline is illegal online and it has been found in practice that national measures to restrict freedom of expression have virtually no effect on new media 
but at any rate a framework has been created in which it could be possible in the future and for that reason  am not against it and  can accept the rapporteurs amendment 
but both moral insight and political common sense mitigate strongly against intervening in iraq for as long as israel is not prepared to implement the united nations resolutions and for as long as israel is not prepared to allow the palestinians to elect their political leadership freely and without external pressure 
but how can we achieve this 
but if rambouillet is step  then step  has to be an international military presence and that certainly has to be a longerterm military presence 
but it must be done in a way which does not cause market turbulence care is required 
but it will not be easy 
but of course there are many other ways and as the commissioner said many of these need to be countryspecific 
but on the other hand we must also bear in mind the right to confidentiality of correspondence as enshrined in the convention for the protection of human rights 
but our fundamental position is that as a general rule we ought not to do so particularly now that we have a european works council whose responsibility it is to solve these types of problem 
but the fishermen must be closely involved and above all the plan must be voluntary 
but there is not yet to be honest with you full agreement on the need for instance to mobilise unspent money from the european community budget 
but where is the proper legislation about it 
but why then in the long term are there so few farmers left and so many unemployed and underemployed in irish rural areas 
by november of this year all member states should put into place criminal penalties for racist and xenophobic crimes as laid down in the framework decision 
by doing this it has trodden parliaments budgetary rights underfoot 
by supporting this resolution we have cleared the way for the commission to fund operations and agencies which focus on the need to reduce infant child and maternal mortality 
by taking responsibility for following through the ratification process of the lisbon treaty by directing the efforts being made by the  member states to meet the challenges europe has to face in terms of energy and climate change growth and employment by continuing the integration process of the western balkans by contributing through your initiatives to the european year of intercultural dialogue which will provide the chance to reaffirm the values of openness tolerance and dialogue that are at the heart of the european project the slovenian presidency is showing that the countries that have joined the  since  are now familiar not only with the eus institutional affairs but also with its internal functioning and the way europe asserts its interests at international level 
can the commission envisage transferring the project to another  
can the presidentinoffice confirm that member states at the barcelona summit rejected the commission proposal to untie development assistance from commercial interests and can he describe the objections made to the proposal 
can we be certain that the council will finalise the dossier with a common position by christmas 
capital adequacy of financial institutions 
certain rights associated with  citizenship are already conferred on the basis of residence  am referring to the right to petition the european parliament and the right to submit a complaint to the ombudsman 
children are our future and make up around one fifth of the population of the  
clarification is undoubtedly necessary 
climate change is happening it is happening fast and therefore we must act promptly and as karlheinz rightly said it is not only a problem but an opportunity 
commissioner do you not think that the greatest problem as regards corruption in the european union lies in the fact that the individual member states frequently go to some lengths to deny the commission the resources it needs to exercise effective control over the various operations 
compliance with those requirements involves huge expenditure to be incurred within a short period of time and for those states it will mean significantly reduced profitability of agricultural production 
consequently considerable pressure will be exerted in some countries as is already the case in the european union as a whole to move towards more expansionist policies 
consider for example the influence of the large law firms and global players in international transactions 
consideration must then be given to natural background emissions which cannot be influenced as well as diffused emissions which are difficult to control and which pollute the water quite substantially 
considering the key role of rural development and agriculture in fighting poverty food insecurity and environmental degradation the commission will present before the end of the year a communication to the council and parliament on fighting rural poverty  an  policy and approach to rural development and sustainable natural resources management in developing countries 
consumer protection policy must also be implemented through consumer organisations 
cooperation between the union and russia must nevertheless be made to move in a more obvious direction 
could the european commission indicate how it sees the intrinsic role of the economic and social committee once the macroeconomic dialogue has been set up 
could you perhaps address these points when you respond to our debate later on 
dialogue has been constant and often fruitful and the proof of this is the number of conciliations successfully concluded often on difficult subjects of interests sometimes widely divergent 
do you consider it conceivable and what will you do now to know for certain 
do you really believe you can convince the public about the european union and especially about europes possibilities and allay peoples fears for the future when in this paper you as good as admit that you know nothing of the social reality in the european union 
does the commission envisage an evening out of the imbalance in milk production between the old and the new member states 
does the commissioner not think it a touch strange that representatives of the industry to be regulated that is to say the industry which produces toys and other items for children should act as chairmen of the standardisation committees whose job it is to establish rules at national or other levels for those products that are released onto the market 
does the council undertake to regard article  of the charter of fundamental rights as fully binding in any agreement with the  on extradition 
drug trafficking remains a massive problem and the illegal trade in small arms whose main recipients are terrorists and criminals is estimated to account for  of the global trade in arms 
due to a lack of statistical data we have no figures on the relationships between the roma population as a whole or roma women in particular and the various types of institutions that make up the health services 
during the past couple of months  and my colleagues have received the very strongest possible representations from small businesses in the carpart retail sector owners of older vehicles  where part replacement is already difficult  and from major consumer organizations all of which support parliaments revised position against the original proposal 
each however wishes to avoid having to implement closer cooperation mechanisms which would be perceived by the citizen as a declaration of failure 
efficient port services enable us to increase european competitiveness and to facilitate growth and employment 
eight years have passed but hopefully we will be bold enough to tell the people that this process is now far advanced and is irreversible 
emission controls are to a large extent covered by existing community legislation 
enlargement can go ahead but we want it to be fair and equitable 
equally deplorably the external frontiers convention has been ready for the last five years but has not been introduced because of differences between the united kingdom and spain over gibraltar 
europe must become more selfsufficient in energy  not by useless wind power nor by biofuels 
european citizens should not simply regard the new farm bill as an instrument that will disrupt trade since its objectives scope and length also acknowledge each countrys right to support its agricultural industry given the practical challenges such as social territorial and environmental balance which cannot be left to the mercy of free trade mechanisms alone 
european initiative in the field of civil protection debate 
even half of that would be too much 
everyone recognises this failure in private 
everything concerning development aid including the rehabilitation of refugees ought to fall within the remit of the directorategeneral for development 
excuse me mrs ahern mrs scallons question ended several minutes ago 
finally commissioner another question on a matter of some concern the nuclear issue 
finally  should like to express the hope that the belgian presidency given its own progressive legislation in this respect succeeds in convincing the member states of the importance of approving the directive by  january and that it can approve this directive under the presidency of mrs onkelinkx 
finally  should like to point out that the question of cooperation with morocco in the fisheries sector was one of the main points on the agenda for president prodis visit to morocco when both sides took the opportunity of reaffirming their wish to conclude an agreement 
finally  wanted to refer to the bilateral technical cooperation and assistance which has been carried out and intensified by the member states with the candidate countries in order to prepare the latter for the application of the community acquis 
finally  would like to welcome the reports reference to the need to define this neighbourhood policy in the near future in agreement with the existing paneuropean organisations such as the  and the council of europe 
finally mr president  wish to say a few more words about environmental policy this is an important element 
finally fourthly the spanish supreme court issued a ruling on  november  in a case involving structural funds and in which siemens was originally implicated 
finally the treaty terms the  s  as supplementary to the aid from member states 
finally the choice proposed in amendment  between the notice being served by a bailiff or being delivered by post should not exist 
finally the report does not sufficiently or vigorously affirm our determination to stop the current social deregulation 
finally we need more training knowhow and research 
finally we propose to keep the special procedures that were agreed under the socalled lamfalussy procedures 
first of all  am pleased to have heard the danish prime minister defend the formula of qualified majority and codecision for community legislation and  hope that it is all our legislation that he has in mind 
first of all the cut would not be based on any objective rules but would merely be the result of highhandedness on the part of a member state 
first of all we need agreement then ratification by all the states 
first there is the question how the member states have established what affordability means 
first the commission recognises that article  of the treaty should be changed at the next revision of the treaty  it supports parliaments position on that 
first to convince the council that if we feel it is useful to amend a legal base under article  of the treaty we do so to give a better democratic basis to an initiative which objectively protects vulnerable groups of people especially children following the breakdown of the family unit 
firstly as was mentioned by mrs ferrerowaldner the united nations human rights council and the european unions role in it as well as the general role of the united nations in defending human rights throughout the world 
firstly in my policy  am building on the alliance between the consumer and the farmer 
firstly it is debatable whether this complicated issue is suited to being raised at european level given the various member states very different systems for pension savings 
firstly on the issue in question we came to a compromise and a compromise must be respected 
firstly the lisbon strategy needs to be revitalised as it is clinically dead 
five of these have been included in the common position taken by the council 
focusing on this aspect will never produce an attractive report because it simply deals with the status quo 
following the liberalisation strategy that is not quite completed yet and the harmonisation that has begun the single market needs this integration strategy if it is to have a viable future 
for denmark and the united kingdom the relevant protocols to the treaty make explicit reference to the socalled opting in and opting out  
for all of us that road started in the shipyards of gdansk in the middle of august  
for although projects have merely been suspended the fact is that they are at a standstill 
for each of these the green paper raises a number of questions for debate 
for example as regards the definition of vulnerable marine ecosystem the report highlights the need to wait for an  food and agriculture organization of the united nations definition according to the best scientific information available bearing in mind the lack of indepth scientific knowledge of these ecosystems 
for example the proportion of women in the national parliament in france is approximately  and in italy it is smaller still 
for many europeans a hens egg is a welcome part of their breakfast 
for many smoking is not a question of choice or pleasure 
for me it is not personal electoral or party interests that count 
for my part  say it should include transborder health threats we have heard about those we know about the flu pandemic 
for that reason we agree with the suggestions of this house to publish only data that has previously been collected at member state level 
for the first time the presidentinoffice of the council met the secretarygeneral of  with the approval of the  
for these reasons  cannot sanction the idea of cofinancing and  call on my colleagues to be most careful on this matter 
for this reason the initial budget proposal should give a realistic picture of all the requirements for next year taking into account parliaments demand that all amounts allocated to pilot projects that are of general benefit to europes citizens should be spent 
for this reason we need a set code for the sharing of people between different member countries of the european union  rather as we have in germany with the system for sharing between individual laender 
forgive me if  do not comment on the question of british beef 
four years ago in northern ireland we had over  mushroom growers today we have   an  drop in those involved in the industry 
from a psychological point of view the destruction of critical infrastructures leads to a loss of public confidence in the european union 
furthermore amendment no  concerning the identification of the ingredients of generic drugs is in order as that will promote a more judicious use of them that is to say generic substitution 
furthermore account was taken of the brain drain from regions of the world such as africa where there is an acute demand for human resources in the health sector 
furthermore paragraph  of the report talks about promoting an actively european mindset among  citizens 
furthermore we cannot agree to an economic steering body as a counterpart of the  
given the instability and the fragility of the most highly populated country in africa where the majority of the population suffer from poverty this motion for a resolution may act as a foundation for strengthening the political dialogue between the european union and nigeria and for a more detailed study aimed at finding viable short and longterm solutions to end this violence and to reestablish a lasting peace 
harmonisation of these waiting times is acceptable if it is due to a concern for the legal correctness of the procedure but  fear that it may be inefficient and instil fear for both material and political reasons 
having said that however  do agree that this common position is an important step forward in the direction of improving and monitoring the health of european citizens and  think we should vote for it 
having said that this is a field in which we have significant active interests and some of our member states have already pointed this out to us 
he was one of the main exponents of the conservative revolution in germany and certainly as pointed out by the international press today an important author of european political thinking and twentieth century literature 
hence my plea mr president 
hence  am clearly a party man 
here we see a country where everyone from the highest to the lowest level is doing everything possible to help and to see that anything that can still be saved is saved 
here the procedures in the member states are utterly different 
how can the commission solve this 
how can we explain that we have the euro  a common currency which is not common to all  but at the same time we are implementing reforms which not even we are able to comprehend or justify 
how codecision will eventually be hammered out in terms of relations between parliament the council and member states in decisionmaking on humanitarian activities is something that needs to be discussed further and perhaps negotiated 
how do you intend to make our people understand that today like always immigration is a source of social and cultural wealth with a role which is and will remain essential in the context of population 
how is it possible not to shudder when thinking of our young people our young women and our young mothers 
how successful are we in fact in pointing the european unions transport systems and private households towards sustainability 
however it should be crystal clear from the relevant scientific advice that the scientific committee did not recommend specific time limitations for the transport of animals as a tool to improve their welfare 
however  also said that it is of course a neighbour country and that is why it is especially important to take issues such as those raised by graham watson christopher beazley and others very seriously 
however  was wondering in view of the subject of our debate  human rights in the european union  whether mr van den broek who is already following a number of dossiers is really the competent commissioner in this matter 
however jacques santer is not to blame for that as with the best will in the world he cannot intervene in his commissioners individual departments 
however because of the increasing importance of the internet as an international organization it is impossible both in practice and also in law to take action against companies or individuals who are proceeding in accordance with the laws of their home country while acting outside of  laws or national regulations 
however because of the specific tasks assigned to  and the pressing need for its establishment the commission has not stood in the way of a firstreading agreement between the legislators 
however for a truly minefree world it is vital that we go beyond this and call for a comprehensive ban that covers all types of mines including antitank mines and fragmentation bombs 
however the council reiterates its strong resistance to the imposition of extraterritorial legislation as a means of pursuing these objectives 
however the main protests are coming from the car industry 
however this reduction should focus primarily on companies that are uncompetitive unfortunately the reality is often different 
however we must seize this opportunity 
however we recognise the difficulties he faced with certain governments 
however we welcome the fact that employment and the environment have been taken into consideration to a greater extent and that progress has also been made in the fight against international crime that decisionmaking procedures have been simplified and that the european parliament will have more clout in terms of legislation 
however what is even more important is the fact that the proposed financing instrument takes account of the calls by the european parliament and of the council for the strengthening of the response capacity in the civil protection sector in europe 
humanitarian aid must make it possible to look forward to the time when people no longer need it 
 agree with him that the estimates in front of us are critical in that they deal with parliaments preparations for enlargement 
 agree with that completely 
 agree with the joint resolution and with the objective of supporting the demands of the saharawi people and above all their demand for selfdetermination  which they have still not achieved after thirty years  but also that this issue must always be balanced with the problem of security and stability that we are facing on the southern border of the european union and that we must take account of the morocco factor a country of  million people where there is a latent danger of islamic regression 
 also asked about the waste  
 also have doubts whether the authors of these resolutions have really taken the trouble to find out exactly what subcritical tests are for they are tests in which no chain reactions ensue in which no radioactive substances are released above the tolerance limits 
 also want to point out that the concept of a safe third country will make it virtually impossible for refugees to enter the european union legally in future 
 also wish to express my gratitude to the court of auditors which has highlighted two main groups of reasons 
 am a great supporter of having interim assessments or current assessments and modifications of the fisheries treaties which the community signs especially when it comes to the developing countries 
 am afraid that the irish no will encourage rather than discourage existing tendencies to renationalise some common policies by prolonging the juridical vacuum the  finds itself in since the rejection of the constitutional treaty 
 am also sure that these countries will be a perfect bridge for developing our relations with russia ukraine and belarus 
 am calling upon the commission and the european parliament to give a firm response to these events 
 am concerned about statements to the effect that the  should be able to intervene anywhere in the world where there are threats to the union s security interests and values 
 am convinced that the carrot rather than the stick approach will achieve a better result at the present state of development of national inspectorates 
 am convinced that the most productive approach to belarus will be one based on pragmatism 
 am happy to say that the  institutions and bodies have shown that in general they are keen to resolve issues that  bring to their attention 
 am happy to say that there is a growing awareness of the need for much greater coordination in both the european council and the general affairs council 
 am not offering my congratulations as a mere formality 
 am obliged to say this quite simply 
 am quite sure that the committee on economic and monetary affairs will miss you 
 am sorry if  spoke too quickly  was anxious not to take up too much time 
 am therefore completely behind the report and hope that it will be adopted in its entirety without the need for any amendments 
 am thinking for example of the oil crisis 
 am very much afraid however that there are still many who are trying to hinder the work of this office 
 am very pleased that we actually managed to follow the way pointed by the european parliament at the councils in nice and goeteborg 
 am very pleased that we have finally got a female trade commissioner and the first female british commissioner 
 announced to you then my intention to propose as soon as possible for approval in the european commission the white paper on renewable energy sources and the framework programme for energy 
 appeal to parliamentarians to sign the declaration in favour of the treaty on the controlarmsorg website 
 believe here commissioner that we need to pass from evolution to revolution in the field of simplification all this is not so that we can abolish cohesion which is a basic policy of the european union but so that we can improve it and make it more effective 
 believe that a constructive approach would be more expedient let us value the positive steps taken by the committee of the regions in answer to our earlier proposals appreciate their cooperative attitude and give them a vote of confidence trusting them to continue their work in a similar spirit as we are preparing to do just that in respect of all the other institutions 
 believe that a unanimous vote by this house on the matter would greatly hasten the subsequent conferences in ottawa 
 believe that the agreement that has been reached on support for the european unions energy policy in the long term providing incentives in the short term for the recovery of the economy achieves both goals 
 believe that this manner of proceeding comes very close to the limits of our rules of procedure and with all due respect to my very good friend mrs andreleonard the situation of the press in algeria is considerably better than in other countries such as tunisia which is in the papers this morning and perhaps also her own country 
 believe that we should be grateful for that 
 believe that in general established transporters of animals are licensed and authorised and comply with best welfare standards  because it is in their vital interests to do so they need to transport animals to arrive in good condition so that they meet the needs of those who are purchasing 
 believe this only has to do with the ecommerce directive so  hope the commissioner will take another look at the issue 
 call on my fellow members and also on national associations to join the citizens of slovakia in their protest and to also sign the written declaration and in that way support our protest 
 call upon the  government to abandon its previous resistance to taking part in such a process 
 can only comment on the main aspects of the changes here 
 changed the report and subsequently  amendments were tabled 
 commented on this earlier but also pointed out its limitations 
 could not describe the european mission patrolling the waters in the region as anything other than a resounding success but this task only involves treating the effects of the disease and not at all the disease itself 
 deeply regret this delay and like my fellow members  hope that you will be able to remedy it as soon as possible 
 dispute the notion that the  can bestow and regulate fundamental rights 
 do find it odd though that the european parliament sets so little store by its own legislative work 
 do not believe that you are proposing that social security and pensions should become a european competence  that would go further than what we are saying  but it is important that it be linked to our demographic situation and our future above all in relation to immigration 
 do not fully agree with recital  of the report 
 do not know what they can think 
 do not object  do not hold strong views on the subject and  certainly do not want to upset my good friend mr martinez but there is a danger that we could create inferior subjects and superior subjects 
 do not see significant progress being made by russia but we shall persevere 
 do not think that we can accept their procedures 
 feel it is important that we are able to discuss these topics at the largescale roma conference being organised on  september and  hope that the question of social inclusion of the roma will be put on the agenda of the european council both separately and as part of the social agenda 
 fully agree with this 
 fully understand why consumers expect us to take speedy comprehensive and effective action appropriate in terms of the gravity of the matter to give them the necessary guarantees that the crisis will be resolved in both the short and the longterm 
 have heard what members are saying on that matter 
 have some critical questions relating to whether the present programme is capable of tackling this problem adequately 
 have to say that the shortage is dropping because last year it was   million 
 hope that the ambition shown by the irish presidency culminating in the draft treaty can now be fulfilled in time for the amsterdam summit 
 hope we will meet again soon 
 hope you will not take that off my one minute of course 
 hope mr presidentinoffice of the council that our recommendation on which we shall vote tomorrow can prove an inspiration to the gothenburg summit and particularly will move the council to involve the european parliament in a more structural way in future in the discussion on the open coordination method on pensions 
 naturally hope that these will be adopted by this house 
 need to point out here and  shall explain why in just a moment that some of the ideas formulated in the morillon report relate to initiatives which have already been set in motion and are being examined by the competent bodies of the union 
 personally oppose the building of new atomic power plants 
 propose we vote from  to  
 shall now pass on to other points mr president commissioner 
 should also like to comment on simplification and better regulation 
 should like to remind the house that parliament adopted  amendments at first reading 
 should like to take this opportunity to give my sincere thanks to commissioner rehn too for his commitment to this region as it is very important to have someone with sensitivity towards the region someone who knows that its needs have to be met appropriately and that that includes a paneuropean approach 
 should point out that it is not a real privilege but a legitimate and ancestral right enabling farmers to use some of their crops for seeding purposes 
 therefore ask that while helping others for instance in africa we do not forget those waiting for our assistance close by 
 therefore think that we need to put the lid on this tendency simply to continue in our old ways 
 think it essential that these demands should also apply to vehicles from noneu countries which use our roads 
 think that because we are at the first reading stage here  do not need to go into each amendment and explain in detail why it cannot be accepted 
 think that these terrible statistics madam president should lead us to think profoundly about the role of our parliament which  do not see as a court that punishes and pontificates but as an institution that has its own effective strategies for seeking by mutual agreement with our partners and on the basis of dialogue cooperation and good practice solutions for eradicating this process 
 think that this in conjunction with recruitment of contractual agents will allow us to achieve flexibility with the required degree of protection 
 venture to doubt that that will add up to a debate 
 very much hope that the mediterranean programme and the enlargement process may be seen as complementary and not conflicting 
 want to make myself clear 
 want to retain this and would not like to see everything forced into line in europe 
 was especially critical of the agreement when it came to the issue of young doctors 
 was present during the gestation of this legislation and hope to be there tomorrow for the final delivery as it were of the new consumer credit baby 
 welcome mr  s taking office 
 welcome mr falconers suggestion that it be referred to the committee on the rules of procedure the verification of credentials and immunities for amendment 
 welcome parliaments position on regional policy per se but  also believe that we must have sustainable development 
 welcome the active involvement of the social partners as well as the input received from other stakeholders 
 will be quite frank in saying that  have a number of difficulties with the schoerling report 
 will comment on six groups of amendments 
 will stop there because you have already discussed that at length this morning 
 would also like to welcome along with the commissioner who is present and those who are absent the fact that we are witnessing a change in perspective 
 would also remind you of amendments nos  and  which the group of the european people s party and european democrats have submitted and which will be voted on tomorrow 
 would ask people to bear in mind that citizenship is not defined by the passport you hold 
 would ask you all to play your parts in this in order that this important institution which is to represent the european union as a whole to the outside world may take concrete form as soon as possible 
 would be very happy to come back to you with concrete proposals once we have the concrete legislative documents 
 would like to express the liberal groups appreciation of the agreement between mr holbrooke and milosevic with its provision for observers and so on commissioner van den broek did however say that military withdrawal is not yet complete and referred to belgrades imposition of tighter restrictions on the media and free speech 
 would like to finish by saying that we should not lose sight in all this of the fact that the responsibility for urban transport systems remains with the towns and cities of europe 
 would like to make yet another remark 
 would like to remind him that when prince victor emmanuel was exiled from his native country he was four years old which in my opinion makes it unlikely that he could have invaded greece 
 would like to repeat my willingness and parliaments willingness to cooperate in the future in order to reach a satisfactory conclusion in terms of this bridging budget bearing in mind as far as possible both your and parliaments priorities 
 would like to request two things mr president 
 would like to tell the house about one of my dreams 
 would like to thank my fellow members for voting in favour of this report 
 would like to thank you my fellow members the commissioner and our colleagues from the panafrican parliament 
 would reply to mr sacredeus that the council is not really qualified in any way to express an opinion on the question he has posed 
 would say the clear and unqualified condemnation by all governments of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations committed by whomsoever and wherever is a very important element and it is a strong push given that this agreement has been negotiated for nearly ten years 
 would thank mr mendez de vigo both for his work within the convention and for his vision of the role he wishes to see the european parliament play a role indeed that the convention will not be able to perform but that parliament is in a position to assume 
 would therefore draw the attention of the commission once more to an owninitiative report  which it so happens was drawn up by me but was approved by plenary session  in which we point out that if the administration of agricultural expenditure in the new and existing member states concerned is not in order the commission must suspend advance payments much more often until the system is in order instead of carrying out controls after the event and imposing penal charges 
 would therefore like to take this opportunity to say a few words about the elections the preparations for the postbonn period and future euafghanistan relations 
 would urge the council to freeze the upgrade of relations with israel until a complete and permanent ceasefire has been agreed by all sides and israel grants unrestricted access for humanitarian aid 
 would however like to request that the vote be deferred if only out of a desire for consistency with this morning s events and also because it would be fitting for a resolution as important as this to be voted in by more than  or  members 
 would nevertheless like to take this opportunity to stress a fundamental concept the reform is not and never has been a political end in itself to be taken out of its wide institutional and political context that is 
ideally  would have preferred a total ban in view of the very high probability that they cause indiscriminate damage to health 
if mrs glase and her group want to reduce tax in order to make undeclared work less profitable this is as good as saying that they want to legalise the economic calculations behind undeclared work and make them the general rule 
if a good policy is to come from this good report  hope that we can convince the council together with the commission that its content must be put into effect politically 
if it is the case that swedens health authorities decide the risks of salmonella infection spreading in sweden are too great and in spite of the fact that you say it is not allowed they introduce random inspections or regular routine inspections as mentioned in mr wibes question what will happen then 
if so those developing countries must then authorise them themselves but how can they do this if they  
if that is the case detainees will be able to choose to plead guilty even if they are not in order to escape the death penalty 
if the commission forwards a communication to the european parliament the latter should at the very least produce a response to the contents 
if the commission is not planning such a communication why is this and how can the commission then guarantee transparent and efficient use of the  
if the united kingdom or ireland or both countries make such a request the council will discuss it and take a decision under article  of the schengen protocol this requires a unanimous decision on the part of the  schengen members and the applicant or applicants 
if they were not global we would not be affected in the way we are so we cannot forget that our leadership our initiatives and our decisions should be followed by a high degree of consensus around our positions with the other partners and the other players 
if we vote and decide on this report today on the  anniversary of the foundation of  this act would represent a future guarantee that we will pay particular attention to the problems of children in the activities of the european parliament 
in  the commission asked all nonoecd countries what control procedures if any they wanted to be applied to the shipment of waste on the green list 
in  mr brown established five famous socalled tests before we could adjudge sterlings accession to the single currency 
in  the european union will have streamlined key policy coordination instruments 
in europe and many countries there is now a real wage problem frequently forcing workers to increase rather than reduce working hours by working overtime 
in iran the critical dialogue has clearly been interpreted in such a way as to convey the impression that we in the  are now better placed to understand and accept their oppressive regime 
in sweden we have combined unemployment targets and employment targets 
in a mission during the next weeks the commission will assess the situation and the possibility of assisting with further measures addressing some of the root causes of the conflict 
in accordance with rule  of the rules of procedure  have received one motion for a resolution at the end of this debate 
in addition we risk making enlargement to the eastern and central european countries intolerable if public opinion feels that the latter are taking away from us what is rightfully ours 
in addition forced labour and child conscription into the army are part of everyday life 
in all these areas we rely of course on the knowledge of the agencies 
in exactly the same way we find it very disappointing that we were unable to include and regulate genetically modified additives which would really have signalled how seriously we take the subject of consumer protection 
in fact although the conservation of cetaceans is subject to protection under the habitats directive the measures contained therein have not proven sufficient to guarantee an appropriate level of protection 
in fact is there a future for this project or should we now be rethinking the whole initiative 
in fact this amendment does no more than reflect in legislation what has long been the practice of most airlines 
in general  am as  say well satisfied with the proposal by the conciliation committee and hope and expect it to be adopted 
in its communication the european commission offers member states the opportunity of taking support measures to help ship owners achieve this 
in my view the directive takes due account of humanitarian concerns about the deportation process notably through the introduction of a maximum detention period of six months 
in my view what we should be expecting from this presidency is not that it should manage to resolve all the problems currently facing the european union  something which would be physically impossible for reasons of time  but that by shaping wills and achieving consensus it should be capable of giving a boost to the process of european integration which is now at a critical point in its timetable 
in other words if we work together the total should be greater than the sum of the parts 
in other words the netherlands presidency implies in a way that liberalising the market will automatically create jobs 
in other words the trend is changing in my country the manufacture stockpiling and export of these weapons were approved by previous governments 
in other words they might think that such a directive would have a serious and positive social dimension 
in our view there is no difficulty 
in particular  was pleasantly surprised in bonn by the constructive attitude being taken by the business world 
in particular he has given no clear commitment to the withdrawal of security forces which are engaged in repression 
in politics there is a tendency to evaluate any given issue depending on whether you come to it from the left or the right 
in reply to some of the other remarks made by mr ribeiro e castro  warn against throwing around quotes which are very difficult to verify 
in reply to the call for new structures let me say that in my view we do not so much need to create new structures as to integrate the environment in all regional assistance measures and we will seriously endeavour to do precisely that 
in response to this which  believe is due to the business model that has been put forward so far and the level of greed that we have in europe  think that with this future in mind we need to put people first 
in several countries there is a saying related to alcohol consumption according to which it should be the exclusive concern of men 
in short it is not a matter of ordering action but of encouraging it 
in short the report which will be presented to plenary tomorrow specifies in detail many areas in which the romanian authorities must continue to make efforts 
in some parts of the union  and  am quite willing to cite the united kingdom  we are not doing as well as we could 
in supporting it however we must not repeat the mistakes of the past by which  mean primarily that we have to give the market more of a chance 
in that context and in that part of the world this is something that must be taken into account 
in the convention  endeavoured to make the  more social since a social europe is what the public rightly expect 
in the european union someone is diagnosed with it every two and a half minutes 
in the absence of a prudent stimulus to productive employment from germany  suspect that there cannot be a sure recovery from the economic recession 
in the codecision procedure for the amendment of the television without frontiers directive parliament approved an amendment aimed at guaranteeing public access to specific sporting events of special importance through openaccess television throughout the whole european union 
in the context of the current budgetary perspectives it would however have been difficult to achieve much more in this respect 
in the course of the coming months the questions and problems raised here should find proper responses from the commission 
in this context  should like en passant to apprise you of one fact which is not without interest because unfortunately it is never adequately taken into consideration in the discussion the austrian railways are the only ones to have increased their share of the freight market in the last few years 
in this context the union urged turkey  as we have done in the bilateral meetings with turkey  to avoid any kind of threat source of friction or actions that could damage good neighbourly relations and the peaceful settlement of disputes 
in this important space we need to develop a number of initiatives 
in this regard  would like to reiterate the need to bring into this debate the concept of a european language of universal communication 
in this respect mr swoboda is quite right when he says that the ball is now in turkey s court 
in this respect a central role falls to the european parliament and  think that the dialogue on monetary policy in the form established between this parliament and the european central bank is a good start for future years in the euro area 
in this way the unions energy policy can be more clearly based on renewable sources and not for example on the further building of nuclear power plants with the risks they entail 
in those degrading circumstances it is hardly surprising that they surpass european clothing output 
in your motion for a resolution you also briefly address the potential implications of a new economy  
indeed as mr dalema said as well it is the presence of foreign troops that is attracting and causing the terrorism 
indeed contrary to what some people have said these people had had their political asylum applications rejected and this bilateral initiative must now be extended at european level 
indeed in this instance the final settlement could threaten the very survival of both boeing and airbus 
indeed the european model is based more than ever on three fundamental values freedom progress and equality 
indeed unlike the  the  will be answerable to a separate body with genuine supervisory powers 
informed consumers are an essential component of economic competition among banks 
instead they are moving backwards 
instead it received support from russia on the basis of a bilateral agreement 
instead the only guidelines originating from europe that carry real weight are found in the stability and growth pact which does the opposite and puts them in a straitjacket 
instead we should focus our energy and money on educating people about the harmful consequences of tobacco consumption targeting each group as individually as possible 
investment is needed to develop regional grids and smallscale power generation however and this includes investment in research 
ireland has great confidence in the work for peace 
is this particular regulation really useful or necessary at  level 
is what is going on here in plenary as you like it 
israel has constantly broken the ceasefire including on  november last year when israeli troops crossed into the gaza strip and killed six palestinians as well as the collective punishment of the palestinian people by means of embargoes shutting off the electricity extending settlements building walls kidnapping leading palestinian politicians and so on 
it affects absolutely everyone in this sector 
it can decide to suspend the partnership agreement with israel 
it could be that this would help the house as a whole to evaluate what is before it now 
it gives cause to hope that by strengthening new technologies and promoting the competitiveness of the european cinema industry european diversity and the maintenance and dissemination of the cinematic cultural heritage will be supported and opportunities will be given for new quality works which will promote the european idea human values human dignity mutual respect equality between men and women and the protection of childhood and youth 
it helps if you are running a business or a public service to know what the rules are but  am appalled that this should hinge on defining the distinction between services of economic general interest and services of noneconomic general interest 
it is turkey that must achieve the required accession changes not us and we must be honest in making our position clear to turkey 
it is a human institution which can always be made better on the basis of experience and debate 
it is a large and important country with a troubled history 
it is a strategic tool for the future of the european union in view of its contribution to such important aspects of integration as research and innovation european space policy and european foreign and security policy 
it is alleged that they were tortured by whippings electrocutions and threats from dogs into signing confessions of being homosexual 
it is also a question of buying the cleanest form of fuel 
it is also crucial that measures be taken at national community and international level to protect authors and composers from piracy and from the theft use and reproduction of their work we believe that there has already been a considerable delay in implementing such measures 
it is also important to stress that due account must be taken of the nearness of objective  areas to objective  areas 
it is as if we had come to a lake and fished it empty and then moved on to another lake and fished that one empty as well 
it is dangerous because tensions between the opposing parties are constantly escalating and because external powers  such as syria and iran  are increasingly exerting an influence 
it is even justified for the financial allocations for this programme to be increased 
it is important in the light of swedens long experience  years of being a country free of military alliances 
it is in any case less than clear why we need to deal with the agreement during this parliamentary term 
it is in this direction with this aim that  feel it is worth continuing to explore what appear to be as yet theoretical unrefined concepts such as decoupling or the endeavour to reduce the impact of transport on development which certainly nobody wants to limit for in that way we will be exploring collateral policies in the field of landuse planning and in the area of optimising infrastructure through the use of new technologies 
it is mainly the early phases of life which right into our own time have been and remain the time for education and training 
it is not a valid approach to only look at the countries but also at the regions 
it is not our understanding that this proposal is aimed at delaying membership of the  for any country which is making vigorous efforts to fulfil the copenhagen criteria and to implement amendments of laws which correspond to the eus acquis communautaire  
it is obvious that european competitiveness would benefit from simplification modernisation and harmonisation of the rules and procedures with regard to the import and export of goods 
it is particularly unacceptable that a worker who in the course of his professional life has made use of his right to free movement and who has paid contributions towards supplementary pension schemes in various member states has only limited rights to a supplementary pension at the end of his career 
it is after all this policy that has led to the exhaustion of fish stocks in the waters off the coast of africa a state of affairs that cannot be remedied by improved monitoring but only by a different set of policies 
it leads us to believe that the commission is a government adopting its policy strategy 
it must be made clear that  accreditation is intended as a reward for those companies which are the real engines of ecological progress 
it seems therefore to have escaped the attention of the author of this startling claim that the  does have a frontier with the rest of the european continent 
it was not however 
it was only yesterday that the representatives of the duma gave an assessment of the current situation within the framework of the delegation for relations with russia  would like to welcome the representatives here today and wish them every success as they deal with the difficult situation before them 
it was so successful that  would like to call for it to be included in this project in other words that the project not only provide finance for people who are going selfemployed but also for those who support these people 
it was very appropriate that you should raise this matter yesterday morning 
it will be possible to carry out experiments and to develop european standards which we are so looking forward to 
it works is effective and does not need to be scrutinised in this way 
it would be ambitious for a twoyear presidency but for one of  days as the presidentinoffice has pointed out  fear that it is too ambitious 
it would be desirable for the commission to present a directive on fires as it has done on flooding 
it would be detrimental to our enterprises if we were to now abolish this framework and  believe that that also accords well with the thoughts of mr audy 
it would be difficult to deny that the inquiry into the  september attacks is currently concentrating on europe and that it shows that for years now the terrorists have been centring their preparations in europe which they have used as their base 
it would be much more efficient if monitoring were also carried out on the basis of prices  and this a priori or at the time licences are issued 
it would be undemocratic to deny those who have not yet ratified the opportunity to do so 
it would strike a blow against innovation with detrimental effects on research smes and europe 
italy is a bad example one not to be followed where the fashion is still to nationalize losses and privatize profit 
item  emphasises this extremely clearly 
its choices are often incomprehensible and its pressure on the council and the member states is often insufficient 
joint action is required 
labelling and presentation of foodstuffs 
ladies and gentlemen mrs duehrkop you have in paragraph   believe a mistake which only originates in the german version because again it refers to an employment budget 
ladies and gentlemen first of all allow me to thank the person responsible for the report of the committee on constitutional affairs mr jauregui atondo for his cooperation 
last but not least experience in america has shown that you cannot save your way out of remaining deficits but rather that you have to eliminate them through growth 
last month we had the european tourism forum in portugal an annual event bringing together all actors in this sector and it is an excellent opportunity for cooperation and for showcasing europe 
last year karen refugees fleeing the repressions took refuge in thailand 
lastly madam president neither the council nor the presidency itself must use the debate as an excuse to do nothing 
lastly of course  would like to express my support of the european unions signing up to the european convention on human rights on my own behalf and on behalf of my group 
lastly the commission also rejects amendment no  because in some member states the information services are provided free of charge by the public authorities 
let me make one thing very clear to the greek cypriots there will never be a plan which fully satisfies either one of the parties 
let me point out though that this regulation will not work without effort 
let me however deal right at the outset with some remarks that still echo these misunderstandings 
let there be no mistake about this all this is due to the disastrous actions of one man the clique surrounding him and his regime  milosevic 
madam president  agree with the commissioner that this is about citizenship of the european union and it is crucial for the facilitation of the free movement of our citizens 
madam president  feel rather like the great blondin just before he started out on his tightrope walk across the niagara falls 
madam president  should like to ask the commission how it can be that when there has been talk on the left of job losses that the integrators the privatelyrun services show the most rapid growth in job opportunities in europe 
madam president ladies and gentlemen  would not be as pessimistic as mrs lucas who spoke before me 
madam president ladies and gentlemen what has occurred in a tributary of the danube is considered by many experts to be an accident on an environmental scale as serious as the scale of the chernobyl disaster 
madam president may  once again thank each and every speaker for their approval and additional remarks 
madam president on monday  had the pleasure of reporting the release to the house of mr tsiakourmas who was kidnapped by turkishcypriot kidnappers and released following a resolution by parliament calling for his release 
major efforts have been made by various parties to reach an agreement at first reading and given the broad majorities in favour of this on the  committee several days ago and on the permanent representatives committee just before christmas  think we will get there 
many of them were blinded 
many of us believe that the situation is already becoming extremely worrying 
many other amendments have been rejected in the councils common position however this was due among other things to parliaments wish that rules covering the transit through  waters of ships en route to ports in third countries would be given a directive of its own 
member of the commission  mr president let me congratulate the committee on economic and monetary affairs and the committee on the internal market and consumer protection and in particular mr karas and mr schmidt for their excellent work in producing a thorough and consistent report 
more and more incidents remain unexplained 
more than   of us gathered on the streets of toulouse on tuesday and more than   on saturday all shouting never again  
moreover it is clear that any successful opposition challenger whom at this moment we do not see on the political scene is highly unlikely to be prorussian 
most importantly we have to achieve greater economies of scale in europe 
mr cornelissen if  know you you surely do not wish to raise a point of order and  cannot give you the floor for any other reason 
mr langen  am sorry but mr mendez de vigo would like to take advantage of the blue card procedure to put a question to you to challenge you 
mr president burundi has by now become a classic example of the destabilizing effect of arms supplies 
mr president europe which is in favour of dialogue empathy and comprehension cannot understand why we should want to offer dialogue to anyone who offers nothing but death 
mr president  do not think you are proceeding entirely correctly 
mr president  have a comment relating to page  of the minutes 
mr president  have said before in this house that inequality and injustice in europe divide those who have work from those who stand no chance of feeling any sense of participation earning their own living or developing their potential 
mr president  indicated in my answer that  assume that the   regions ie the   level is in principle the suitable level 
mr president  think it is a good idea to have a joint debate because  would not want to force a new debate tomorrow morning to be followed by a vote on thursday  hours later 
mr president  welcome this resolution which highlights the declining political situation in cambodia 
mr president  would like to put a couple of questions to commissioner wulfmathies 
mr president  would say  and  repeat  that through no fault of your own or of the danish presidency the council of the european union is not following up the proposals that mr vitorino has been making for some time now so that the european union can in fact establish control 
mr president madam commissioner the car is part of our freedom 
mr president according to article  the transeuropean networks must contribute to the strengthening of the communitys economic and social cohesion 
mr president before discussing the budget  would like to convey our good wishes to our commissioner mr fischler on his birthday today 
mr president if  may say so  too find it odd that the council president merely listens to the commission and the rapporteurs and then completely ignores the debate 
mr president ladies and gentlemen  should first like to thank the rapporteur mrs duehrkop duehrkop who was very receptive to the proposals from the committee on womens rights which sought above all to enshrine the concept of mainstreaming in the budgetary procedure in other words to incorporate equal opportunities for men and women into all european policies 
mr president ladies and gentlemen since  have not had the chance to engage in a proper political debate on the commissions actions  will use this one meagre minute to express my disappointment with the commissions actions which should be criticised in three areas to my mind 
mr president ladies and gentlemen ten years ago the political will for this ambitious project of the euro came into being 
mr president ladies and gentlemen the green group entirely agrees with the council of europes committee of ministers in their decision provisionally to defer acceptance of croatia as a member of that council 
mr president successive petrol crises and the political and social fragility of the main oilproducing countries demonstrate the importance for our economies of the concept of selfsufficiency in energy 
mr president the amendments tabled by our group reflect this aim 
mr president we approve the approach of the informal ghent council which reaffirmed its solidarity with the united states and confirmed and strengthened the implementation of an action plan containing  measures to combat terrorism 
mr president we have before us two resolutions on fundamental freedoms in serbia and kosovo 
mr presidentinoffice of the council  would urge you to see to it that the hearing you are to hold on the  with the president of the convention mr herzog should not be a mere formality 
mr presidentinoffice  know that just  days after the beginning of your term in office you cannot have a personal position and view about the matter 
mr tillich the budget rapporteur general has said that he intends to reject amendments that would cost  million  out of a total budget of   million  the eaggfguarantee budget for the sake of budgetary rigour and for introducing the single currency 
mrs ahern  will check that and write to you again 
mrs bonino will certainly explain the content to you in more detail if that is what you want 
mrs cathy ashton was nominated to the commission with the full confidence of the  government 
mrs ibrahim we stand shoulder to shoulder with you in rejecting this cruelty and our rejection will be total 
my irish  colleagues and myself appeal to all member states to maintain readily available nationwide postal services or to set up such services in countries where they are not provided at present 
my fifth and final point mr president is a remark to the council and a vote of thanks to the commission 
my report notes that the planned measures must not infringe the property rights of  citizens 
my third and final point is that an institution that is particularly close to us the council has long proved itself incapable of calling for a ceasefire despite the commendable attempt made by the finnish presidency and the unanimous appeal launched along these lines by parliaments conference of presidents 
naturally this will include a clear statement on cyprus by the commission 
nec spe nec metu or without hope or fear 
neil commission mr president with your permission  would like to make a commission statement on the effects of the financial crisis in russia and on matters relating to corruption and money laundering 
nevertheless  believe that parliaments position is the right one 
nevertheless  think we should pay tribute to the former commission which is still in place in a caretaker capacity we should pay tribute to the dignity of its members and to the dignified manner in which the commission decided to resign choosing not to continue in office 
nevertheless as we know some members of the group of the european peoples party christian democrats and european democrats took the view  not in response to todays decisions by the general affairs council but as early as last thursday immediately after the conference of presidents  that that was not on that cuba was at all events to be discussed immediately under urgent procedure 
nonetheless the european council could have been more ambitious with regard to the actual functioning of the council and better cooperation with parliament in speeding up legislative procedure 
not only do forest fires contribute to climate change as a result of massive  emissions they also gradually reduce the size of our forests and the unions carbon sink capacities 
nothing can be more important than that 
notwithstanding the ambiguous waverings of certain governments the weight of the european union was irrelevant for the purposes of military action and europe was seen to have no autonomous will even with respect to the alliances 
now that the overall amount has been reduced to   million from the   million that this house and the commission originally agreed on that is the amount with which for lack of any understanding on the councils part we are obliged to manage 
now the definitive choice of europe cannot be refuted by anybody really 
now you need to start putting it into practice 
now in conclusion  would like to thank everyone the commission the british and luxembourg presidencies and members who have supported us

other shortcomings can also have major consequences 
otherwise we will be jointly responsible at least indirectly for gassing human rights and democratic values in russia in exchange for gas from russian pipelines 
our authority cannot be established at the expense of the other institutions 
our goal is to ensure that it is selective in a way which benefits enterprises and groups of workers which are encountering particular difficulties 
our group supports this commitment and has voted in favour apart from a few who have voted otherwise on individual grounds 
our institutions too engage in privatisation and externalisation but without putting in place the social plans such as we  at least in my own country  impose upon our companies following negotiation with the unions

secondly there will be a great deal of movement on the labour market 
secondly where terrorism is concerned we have still not achieved a properly balanced approach

that is quite simply what the commission must do it was created for that purpose 
that is the inherent position which is why we are rejecting the compromise 
that is what creates jobs and new opportunities 
that is what shocks me 
that is what the credibility of the union and its values requires of us 
that is why it is so useful as the commissioner has said that we have this dialogue on human rights 
that is why the council must as a matter of urgency look into the necessary revision  and  would emphasise this point  of the dublin  regulation 
that is why we also need to differentiate 
that is why amongst the amendments tabled particular emphasis should be placed on research

the greens were also such an entity before there were enough of them to form a political group 
the peoples movement against the  cannot support mr broks paternalistic exposition and conclusions but at the same time is refraining from voting against the report out of respect for the candidate countries right to decide for themselves  through fair and impartial referendums we hope for the best but fear the worst  whether they desire  membership

the smes play a key role in this context in that they act as a conduit between the universities and the business sector 
the socialists expect the upcoming french presidency to ensure that the draft social agenda makes rapid progress and is substantial in content

the  authorities who were responsible for monitoring the activities of the company in other member states too never informed those member states that there was a problem 
the  for example listed the country as part of what they called the axis of evil and the  too is very forthright in its criticism of the syrian regime 
the union must have its own part to play too 
the abuse of new forms of employment must also be prevented along with bogus selfemployment and undeclared work 
the additional credits are not structural funds 
the adoption of principles of good manufacturing practice by legally binding measures for specific categories of products is not appropriate in the case of foodstuffs 
the allegations about derogatory slogans being chanted at sports events were also built on shaky ground as the slogan death to hungarians had been put up as a provocation by an individual of ethnic hungarian origin

the closer we come to the third phase to the single currency  which is essential and has to be maintained  the clearer it becomes that economic and monetary union has not been brought into effect as a whole and more particularly that economic union has not moved forward 
the company is moving in the right direction but we should send the signal that throughout the european union we want fair and balanced industrial relations and observance of the law so that consumer disruption of this kind can be avoided and workers can get on with their lives and so that people with over  years service in such companies receive the justice they deserve 
the consumer pays twice he or she pays via tax for the aid and then pays the artificially high prices for everyday goods

the garlic producers have raised the possibility of setting a maximum world trading quota and of even setting a deterrent tariff barrier for quantities above this maximum world trading quota 
the gas directive which is something the dutch presidency is interested in might also have to be written off since it is based on much the same principles as the electricity directive 
the group of senior civil servants led by undersecretary of state lars danielsson should also of course receive particular mention in this context 
the human rights debate has been supplanted by concern for business interests 
the impact of pollution and the careless depletion of natural resources does not stop at the borders

the level of restrictions on the spontaneity of market processes and the level of political regulation over the economy are constantly increasing 
the list of subjects is already extensive 
the logic of the european globalisation adjustment fund is still intolerable nonetheless 
the main issue in the new directive is not whether compulsory reserves will be for three or four months but the fact that controls of reserves and regulatory competence are being shifted from the member states to the european commission

the next item is the joint debate on

the next item is the speeches on behalf of the groups

the population of finland is five million and around   cars will be sold this year 
the previous speaker was allowed eight minutes 
the price of wheat has not changed however as a result of biofuels  cannot cause these sorts of changes 
the problem is exacerbated by the liberalisation of the energy market and the privatisation of power stations and transmission grids 
the problem is not comitology itself but the question is whether article  is in a correct relationship to articles  to  that is whether the most important points really are in articles  to  
the problem is that it does not cover antitank mines 
the problems of ethics which you have rightly highlighted are truly worrying 
the procedures were commenced in july  concerning illegal arms trading influence peddling misuse of corporate funds breach of trust and receiving stolen goods 
the question is not however of a purely institutional nature it is also a budgetary issue 
the real problem is that if this agreement does not come about millions of european citizens will accept lower guarantees of protection for their personal data in order to continue flying to the united states 
the report highlights a number of serious problems especially the occurrence of honour killings and violence against women 
the report should have examined which issues should be considered at various levels local regional national and european  level 
the report which we have received on this is an inadequate one yet again furthermore the member states have been found wanting and above all the bodies set up by the european union to implement the directive have not met their targets 
the role of parliament our right is on the contrary to shoulder our responsibilities 
the same has happened under other circumstances 
the second parts of amendment nos  and  seek to extend the timeperiod for the holding of traceability information from five years to ten years 
the second question concerns the role of the european parliament and it must be noted that at present it is too limited 
the short answer to this is no 
the third way is for local and regional authorities to mobilise action programmes through the social fund to deal for example with the closure of small airports or local problems caused by redundancies or crises in specific sectors so that they can be dealt with at regional level 
the three countries mentioned have all played an important and active part through their bilateral diplomatic relations with belarus

the vote in the committee on the environment enabled us to take this step and it was accepted by the representatives of the various political groups within the committee on the environment for which  thank them 
the vote will be taken at  noon 
the vote will take place at  am 
the vote will take place tomorrow at   noon 
the whole industry is in crisis 
the work with which we as a committee tried humbly to make progress is at risk of being undermined 
their effects can be both immediate and longlasting 
then whatever active demand loses in public spending it will gain from increased exports and we shall avoid tax increases 
there are also a number of further points which are worth conveying to parliament 
there are many young people who would enjoy farming working in the open air and close to nature surrounded by plants and animals 
there are problems and challenges that are clearly beyond the scope of individual member states and that call for a common approach this being especially obvious as already said in an area without internal borders 
there are some very important areas where consumer protection can work at a community level and  say that as a british conservative 
there are various figures of varying degrees of importance that need to be compared 
there comes a point when it is no longer clear what data may be used by europol and how it may do so and what data may not be used 
there have already been a high number of victims because of an excessive use of force and we are deeply worried about the extrajudicial killings perpetrated by israeli security forces 
there have of course been omissions  am not going to list them here they are well known 
there is a possibility but no decision on the matter that the use of nuclear energy will increase ie that slovenia will resort to it in the future as well 
there is a very innovative research climate in israel which relative to its  still spends more on research than does the  and is a world leader as regards the number of scientific publications per capita 
there is another question too among the many referred to in mr tindemanss report which is not mentioned in the chapter on the internal security of the union  refer to secessionist movements whether violent or otherwise which are sources of instability and disintegration that are difficult to reconcile with the democratic development of society 
there is currently an urgent need for small suitable boats to be donated 
there is great potential and we are looking forward to hearing from the commission later this year with proposals to encourage biofuels and other alternatives as a supplement  and perhaps a complement  to oil at present 
there is huge resistance to incineration because of health fears unreasonable in my view but the fears are there 
there is no doubt that we have reached a fundamental point highlighted by mrs frassoni given that we now have an automatic information system 
there is no faith that the new measures implemented recently are actually being taken stock of 
there is no reason for the  to support this particular energy source 
there is only one serious thing in this story we now know that mad cow disease is transmissible to man 
there is shadow in the area of cohesion policy 
there needs to be a reference to proportional liability not joint and several liability which would create a system based on mistrust 
therefore the involvement of education in sport is of special significance 
therefore we are considering stronger measures to prevent the reimportation of tieredprice products into the community 
therefore  believe that the proposal for common procedures by  member states to decrease levels of accidents and violence is highly effective 
therefore  would say very clearly that  think that at the moment we are not meeting the copenhagen criterion on the ability of the  to take on new members without losing momentum and  would simply say mr president that it would send a very strong signal if we said to the people europe is taking its destiny back into its own hands by being able to state where its borders are 
these are issues which must be discussed at the summit as well 
these are technical matters which the linguistic lawyers themselves will be able to attend to 
these are the explanations which  am able to give you on behalf of the european commission 
these are very serious organizations doing extensive environmental work 
these assurances should be put into practice and there should be cooperation with the  special rapporteurs 
these individuals lives are now at risk 
these statements in some degree declare people in the member states incapable of managing their own affairs and are thus evidence of an unpleasant attitude towards the population 
they also condemned the tendency many rich countries have of favouring the use of chemical fertilisers and new technologies in africa instead of encouraging the sustainable development of agroecology 
they have already been adopted and are coming into force 
they have the right to expect a timely response as well as an effective one and while the commission has discretion as to how to proceed in a certain case  ie whether or not to instigate infringement proceedings  it does not have the discretion to fail to adopt a position within a reasonable amount of time which was the case in this matter 
they only need the appropriate access to a doctor 
they will look into the matter thoroughly 
thirdly  am particularly pleased that the inkind contributions are now recognised as eligible expenditure 
thirdly in future the economic and social committee should be take much more intensive action to evaluate the effects on undertakings once provisions have entered into force 
this  did because although the report on how marketing and advertising affect equality between women and men contained a lot of good ideas that  wholeheartedly support including teaching children to use their critical faculties when it comes to the media and teaching people to question sex stereotypes  thought it went too far in general 
this also goes for information on for example what projects where are receiving what support 
this applied to a sum of around   billion in  
this applies to citizens of the  as well as countries and citizens throughout the world 
this chair would allow us to determine to what extent the blame lies with the conservatives driven by exaggerated  neoliberalism and to what extent with the social democrats who have not pressed firmly enough for social balance 
this clearly illustrates therefore that this reorganisation is a european matter that should be dealt with by the european works council 
this could lead to clearly unnecessary damage arising solely from an ignorance of the facts which in addition to the requirement formally to publish such information would require genuine and effective publicity in a borderless area this will only be possible by using the most uptodate techniques and information technologies and the voluntary publishing of information in other languages 
this effect which comes from the supply side also however needs support from the demand side and it is precisely public procurement that can have an impact on that when it can be shown that there are grounds for including environmental criteria in an invitation to tender 
this functional separation can provide the right incentive to providers of network services not to discriminate between customers for wholesale services this can in turn mean that the conditions for real competition in the telecom markets are improved 
this gesture of solidarity from the rest of europe will be most welcome in my constituency 
this has been accompanied by some improvements in recent years in the situation as regards civil and political rights 
this impact remains to be felt however 
this incident at a time when pressure on the organisers of and participants in the protest movement is being stepped up is all the more worrying in that the moldovan parliament has just voted to lift the immunity on several other members of the opposition as mr swoboda has just pointed out 
this includes the simplification of legislation in close cooperation with the new member states and with the old member states and providing better information and guidance in connection with consumer rights and the opportunities citizens have to work and establish in an enlarged union 
this instance involved responding to a request for assistance by lithuania as a result of the redundancies that have occurred at  firms active in the civil construction sector 
this is a completely unnecessary measure the work is being done perfectly well as things stand and involves more countries than simply the member states of the  
this is an issue on which  as we have demonstrated  we must work together 
this is because the question of removing the obstacles to the free movement of workers caused by supplementary pension schemes which is at the heart of this problem has not yet been answered 
this is going to be invaluable for giving europe an advantage visavis the united states and japan in the future 
this is in no sense designed to stop that 
this is mainly due to the presidentinoffice of the council 
this is not only about the liberation of aung san suu kyi but also about the liberation of the burmese people as a whole 
this is not so in the case of the members of the european parliament elected in italy 
this is the crux of the matter and not only with regard to the three reports we are dealing with today but with regard to enhanced cooperation in general 
this is unacceptable and the proceedings should be dropped immediately 
this is why  fail to comprehend why a number of proposed amendments to my report claim that the court s judgement has strengthened the position of the european investment bank and the european central bank in their opposition to the regulation 
this is of course something that could really reinforce our role on the global scene but also make a real difference for these people who are caught in a very difficult situation 
this item therefore has to be given high priority at the summit 
this may not be enough 
this means more than the appropriate increase in the budget suggested in the commissions proposal 
this means that it will be easier for the business community to comply with this directive 
this means that transparent bases for calculation nondiscrimination against airlines and a set consultation procedure are some of the factors used to establish fair airport charges 
this mechanical excavation work would certainly cost  billion 
this morning  myself held talks with european parliament representatives on the preaccession instruments with a view to intensifying the dialogue and the exchange of information between the council and parliament as we had agreed in the trilogue 
this question is particularly crucial given that in december  the european court of justice delivered a judgment ruling that the different treatment of employees at the european joint fusion project  was illegal 
this report covers nearly every aspect of policy 
this should also apply to failure to comply with the objectives of environmentally sound socially compatible and sustainable development 
this suggests that on their arrival in the country such children should be assigned welltrained legal representatives who will be in a position to best represent their interests 
this was the famous doctrine of american isolationism from which the americans emerged for the first time during the first world war and which they completely abolished with the second which resulted in the united states following the fall of the walls becoming a worldwide and ubiquitous superpower 
this would also help them to reintegrate more easily and more quickly into the working environment 
those amendments reflected the agreement between the different groups but  insist that technically this text is better 
those are the priorities advocated by our political group and most of them can also be found in the european pact on immigration and asylum which needs to be implemented on the basis of concrete action 
those in our countries who are striving for peace should call as was done at the time of the korean war for an extraordinary session of the united nations general assembly to be held 
those opposed to this have to answer to their conscience to their religion and to their voters as to why you believe some people should be treated differently from others that they should not have equality 
thus as regards the ratification of the treaty of lisbon you are required to ensure that no member state apart from ireland sets the bad example of organising a referendum including countries that have made firm commitments to do so 
thus in the french overseas territories there are dramatically high levels of unemployment  in martinique  in guadeloupe  in reunion 
thus it is said that things are going badly but because we are all responsible 
thus reconstruction must not be examined as a mere logistical construction process there is of course the question of construction but there is also the question of reshaping and orientating a society and reshaping and orientating a society includes political economic social and cultural issues 
to conclude it is evident that the protection of human rights and the international conventions must be respected in every phase of foreign policy security and defence operations from planning to the implementation phase and this must be achieved especially by continuous training for the teams in this sphere 
to do so is not only europes vocation but also in its interests 
to give a precise answer to your question  would say that while this organ is clearly informal it is nevertheless a fact that its work must be transparent 
to prove that this european project obviously needs to evolve but that it has borne fruit especially with the community model which has functioned well and with community policies which have been so useful 
to simplify the task the europe of the nations group some time ago proposed the creation of a europe of variable geometry  on the basis of several cooperation associations which would enable candidate countries to join the european union by moving progressively from one association to another as appropriate 
today we are celebrating the european day of languages and you mrs reding made a major contribution to its creation 
todays vote was exceptional for two reasons 
today however he is illegally imprisoned in a caracas jail following two years of detention with no coherent case being made against him 
today the french mistraltype helicopter carrier arrived in st petersburg 
today we are facing the challenge of balancing further enlargement with the european unions absorption capacity 
today we are not only linking economics and the environment 
together with my group  identify three key points in this context 
true it is much more difficult now and it is going to take time but it is absolutely essential if we want europe to make progress we must make the effort to get all europeans involved and to do that we need to unite the european camp 
unfortunately the  is hellbent on tradeblocktotradeblock negotiations and for this reason  abstained 
unfortunately  come across these far too often in most countries 
unfortunately however that is not possible because both sides are protagonists of the worldwide capitalist system and the attack it has mounted against working people and seen in that light the agreement being promoted supplements the mechanisms which serve their aims and ambitions 
unilateral mutual contempt leads to a dehumanisation of action 
unless we can establish reasonably viable state and ruleoflaw structures the disaster will never end no matter how much assistance we provide 
verification of credentials see minutes 
we accept the amendments adopted by the committee on transport and tourism which reflect the councils position and the new compromise amendments proposed by mr rack and supported by the various political groups 
we aim to work for the interest of the european union as effectively and efficiently as possible 
we also believe that women must be protected from violent acts and those responsible for such acts should face the full force of the law 
we are aware that this summit comes at a time when both the presidential and duma elections in russia are imminent 
we are convinced that criminal law  and we are talking about criminal law here  can only be adopted by the actual legislature and not through the comitology process 
we are dealing with taxpayers money they have entrusted their money to us and they rightly expect to see positive results within the context of overall value for money 
we are now on the eve of new elections and  can only look back on the debate which we had here four or five years ago when we were in the heat of the discussion about the financial difficulties that the santer commission was having at the time 
we are therefore opposed to this distorted text and in the end following a last minute uturn the european parliament rejected it to our great satisfaction 
we are therefore quite prepared to support the liberals amendment to keep aid independent from the donor states interests for we need to give industry in macedonia and the region the best possible opportunities with the aid money available for reconstruction 
we are trying here to coordinate disaster aid as sensibly as possible 
we are well aware of the importance of that and  know commissioner byrne is equally aware of it 
we believe that it is a magnificent initiative on a european level to dedicate a special year to languages in europe to knowledge of them and to the recognition throughout the whole of the european union of the importance of languages as a reservoir of cultural and historical wealth and an expression of the very identity of the societies which make up the union 
we blame it for being stupid and malicious 
we can intervene in two ways under the competences laid down in the treaty 
we can only be credible if we too do our homework 
we cannot preach in favour of democracy and liberty if we do not set an example ourselves 
we do not believe that we should create other monitoring posts or institutions 
we do not for example believe that the  should decide on matters such as childcare maternity and paternity leave or abortion legislation in the member states 
we draw attention to the fact that it is not actually known how many tests for cosmetics within the european union involve the use of animals since most member states are failing to comply with the obligation to collect those statistics including germany 
we fortunately have the opportunity to improve these points tomorrow in plenary 
we fully respect the right of individual member state governments to decide on temporary restrictions in respect of the free movement of workers within the context of the accession treaty 
we have all spent many hours talking about european citizenship and it is time to realise that that citizenship applies to all irrespective of race 
we have begun our work in committee but we shall not be ready by the second may partsession 
we have cases changing from one to the other profiting only the lawyers 
we have consulted many environmental ngos in brussels and at home and have built their suggestions into our amendments 
we have discussed many of these issues with the european parliament and we hope that this will continue over the coming weeks 
we have just approved the new charter of fundamental rights 
we have just prepared the green paper on the information society as  have said 
we have set our goal of a wideranging agreement to follow the current partnership and cooperation agreement 
we have tabled many proposals as to how the battle against trafficking in women may be waged 
we have therefore followed very closely and welcomed the five rounds of talks which have taken place up to now between the special envoys of the dalai lama and the chinese government 
we have to face the challenge of an ageing population and this will put even more pressure on the european health workforce 
we have voted against the mayer report as we feel that the basic fault lay with the  agriculture policy itself 
we have voted in favour of the present report as we consider that attempts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and achieve the targets in the kyoto protocol are important 
we in europe are bound to follow the united nations convention on the rights of the child 
we know that many citizens want to see a clear constitution 
we maintain that the  should not be given any decisionmaking competence for social policy and taxes 
we must defend and safeguard the designations of origin of our quality produce such as our wines in the wider world including the world trade organisation because our future in the european union and that of our export trade depends on topquality products for which there is a prosperous and discerning consumer market within and beyond the frontiers of the union 
we must extend our coordination beyond financial matters to cover broader questions of economic policy and we need to take account of both the social and the environmental dimension which mrs myller spoke of referring to what  said and emphasised earlier and which  would like to clarify better now that the countries which provide a high level of social protection such as denmark and sweden also manage to be extremely competitive 
we must extend this measure to include the supply of local markets and to the sale of natural products from primary production 
we must find a way to enable young people in belarus who are suffering discrimination in terms of access to knowledge in their own country to gain access to the benefits of the erasmus mundus programme 
we must help others to help themselves 
we must improve the image of the entrepreneur in europe and encourage young people to set up their own businesses 
we must not forget that since then it has suffered an earthquake drought and famine 
we must use this report as a springboard to draw up a plan to combat all levels of harassment which starts as simple sarcasm and disdain coupled with intimidation humiliation and undermining and ends up in more violent acts a plan which will be applied irrespective of whether it is topdown harassment of an employee by a superior bottomup harassment or horizontal harassment 
we must welcome this political act by the prodi commission and must thank commissioner almunia 
we need a new political strategy one that is more discriminating 
we need a sufficient budgetary amount so that the european commission can effectively perform its control mission in the member states and guarantee supervision of the equivalent system with those countries 
we need to alter our transport policy 
we need to promote technology and not continue to put obstacles in its way 
we need to take an understanding approach to these agencies in light of the rather special circumstances surrounding this issue 
we now need a holistic approach to peace democracy security and stability in the middle east 
we obviously support the right of authors artists composers performers writers and journalists etc to make a reasonable living from their work 
we of course unreservedly acknowledge the fact that it is very important that the work programme is clearly comprehensible politically which is the case here this does not however exempt you from presenting a legislative programme 
we see that combined efforts are giving results 
we should acknowledge the merits of the debt relief initiative currently applied the highly indebted poor countries  or  initiative which was launched in  
we should debate the advantages and the changes involved in it with them 
we should not raise workers expectations too high for example with rigid  but mistaken  mathematical formulae such as   less working time equals   more jobs 
we should reflect on this today in making sure that we continue our commitment 
we should therefore congratulate ourselves on this outcome 
we should of course recollect that at least   people have died in darfur during the fouryear conflict and more than two million people have been forced from their homes 
we should secondly be developing our capacities so we still need time to make necessary contributions to crisis management in the area around the european union which must be both civil and military 
we support the rapporteurs idea to start simultaneous negotiations with all candidate countries 
we tabled amendment no  so as to ensure that the trial involving reduced  rates for highly labourintensive services could continue beyond  december of this year 
we take note and this will appear in the minutes 
we therefore have to send out a very clear message that we remain committed to the permanent restoration of peace and stability in the region 
we urgently need a union charter of basic rights because only such a charter will enable us to define what discrimination is and why it must be eliminated 
we were able to confirm this for ourselves during our visit to this still young country we saw the widespread poverty and the problems facing health and education but also some possibilities that are opening up such as initiatives arising from cooperation which are taking place at every level either under the auspices of the government or which are being implemented by ngos the interesting use of microcredit even though it benefits limited numbers of people and the role and the particularly difficult situation of women 
we will be determined to do our best for the balkans and kosovo but at the same time we will be realistic for those other policies which parliament considers to be important 
we will never consider it to be enough 
we would ask you to support our group s amendment whereby islands and the outermost regions are added to the subparagraph of article   in order to avoid unnecessary reclassification 
we would like to point out that relations between the european union and the mediterranean countries are based on a global strategy one of the elements of which is undoubtedly fishing and therefore we trust that the moroccan government will adopt an attitude which reflects the current urgency in the negotiations which are taking place 
we all of us are unprepared and we are in fact unwilling to listen to something so uncomfortable 
well from the first day that europes founding fathers began to dream began to imagine this common entity  a single entity drawing together millennia of history geography society and common values  well from that moment the founding fathers themselves thought of having common rules what we today call the constitution 
what are we going to do next year 
what is missing in the strategy is a link between environmental policy and the previously mentioned areas 
what is needed is an evenhanded and consistent agreement that guarantees the protection of data and deliberately restricts its use to the combating of terror and terrorism 
what is the proven probability of accident at what cost and with what hopes of recovery in how many hundreds or thousands of years 
what we are pleased about is that it was possible to find a solution that did not involve large cuts in other programmes but that we found the funds in the flexibility instrument and the emergency aid reserve 
what we would like to see and what mrs paulsen would like is for commissioner bolkestein to promise here and now that the matter is being monitored carefully and that there is a readiness to implement measures and carry out an investigation and an analysis 
whatever the outcome of the revision of the feed ban may be  can assure you that the commission will not reauthorise the use of meatandbone meal in animal feed unless every possible risk to consumers and animals can be excluded and the provisions can be controlled properly 
when can we expect ratification or will you follow us along the path of the proposed directive on this matter 
where nuclear power stations are safe we must allow them to be used particularly those in the candidate countries 
while welcoming the statement by the council presidency on  september  words are not enough 
whilst  found this observation quite persuasive it is of course dangerous and misleading because nothing which we are currently doing in europe in terms of the economy or the environment can be seen in isolation from potential global developments 
why does the decentralist mr santer insist on having completely identical rules for drinking water which is treated and drinking water which is taken straight from the groundwater 
will that also be covered by future compensation schemes yes or no 
with regard to the individual case that has featured so prominently in the contributions to this debate namely azambuja the allegation that the company is making enormous profits on the backs of its workforce and the european taxpayer would be rather hard to substantiate for the days when general motors recorded profits are long past both in europe and in other parts of the world 
with this in mind the recommendations made by the rapporteur regarding the southern europe corridor especially nabucco and the interconnection of the gas and electricity networks running from north to south in southeast europe must be considered and implemented as quickly as possible 
without getting into an assessment of the main report which naturally is the responsibility of the committee on development from a budgetary point of view  would like to say that the new financial framework proposed by the commission meant an increase of  in the new programme in comparison with the previous one which ended on  december  which reflects the importance the community attaches to this programme with a view to improving the reproductive health of people without sufficient economic resources in the developing countries 
without this there is a risk that existing inequalities will be exacerbated 
work arising from the commissions report on the effectiveness of the internal market will be pursued actively as will the citizens first initiative 
yes then to starting out with those who share the results of the convention  an honourable compromise  on the new european community path 
yesterday  explained the detailed arrangements for dealing with potential conflict of interest problems that might arise in a portfolio 
yesterday according to the press there was a meeting of the advisory committee in which  it is alleged  several member states decided not to support the commissions proposal for action as a tax of about   in particular was mentioned 
yesterday the president of the commission gave a positive response to stephen hughess request 
yet the kurdish issue is central to the democratisation process in turkey 
you did not choose the ambition of a model but settled for an accommodation and for staying afloat which in practice has proved to be a framework of shifting sands which has exalted the power struggle between powers and between countries 
you have explained that it is the financial policy and the monetary policy that must be coordinated but can you specify the particular areas of economic policy in which it is planned to promote integration in connection with  
you need to tackle that issue 
you see the only way to stop countries acting in their own national interest is to take that power away from them  to form a treasury department there in frankfurt that has power over tax and power over government spending 
your record is appalling and the answer has got to be for goodness sake keep your nose out of this 
your response would be most welcome 
author  mr president syria is an important country in the middle east and has a vital role to play in reducing the ability of iran to support terrorist actions via its proxies hezbollah and hamas against israel 
draftsman of the opinion of the committee on the environment public health and food safety   madam president commissioner you will appreciate that  am extremely pleased that we are able to vote on this dossier at the last minute as many citizens as well as parliament have been calling for measures to combat the cruel practice of commercial seal hunting for many years 
in writing   the european commissions draft directive on working time often criticised then rejected in  was clearly an ultraliberal and internationalist tool all the aspects of which formed an antisocial arsenal that could result in abuses in particular with the optout principle which allows the maximum weekly working time of  hours to be exceeded 
in writing  british conservative meps voted in favour of mr albertinis owninitiative report on sustainable european transport on the basis that it provides a clear policy framework that will increase efficiency and tackle transports burgeoning impact on climate change

internalising emission costs by pricing emission rights at sufficiently high levels 
it conceals the fact that there are countries in economic divergence with the  in the name of nominal convergence under the stability pact and the euro 
on behalf of the  group   madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen  would like to begin by thanking reinhard rack for his excellent report and  thank the commission for having firstly drawn up the green paper which is now the subject of a broad consultation and which is going to result in an action plan by the end of  
on behalf of the  group   mr president high animal welfare standards are an expression of civilisation and of respect for ones fellow creatures 
on behalf of the vertsale group   madam president  would like to start by strongly challenging the assumption that seems to lie behind this oral question

the existence of a group with special difficulties in rejoining the labour market comprising young people older workers women ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities 
the obligation for public authorities to actively assist citizens in their search for information encouraging them to use the new technologies to answer their requests 
 mr president today the  general assembly voted to create a human rights council to replace the  human rights commission whose position has been compromised 
 mr president the global challenges facing the european union have never been greater yet we will have to face these challenges with limited resources 
 scientific research has become an essential instrument in implementing the common fisheries policy and is crucial to the sustainable management of resources 
 as  only have one minute to speak  should like to make it clear that we are opposed to the implementation of a programme that seeks to promote equal opportunities by breeding hostility between the sexes or in other words by encouraging women to regard men as the enemy in their fight for better treatment 
commissioner  am of course sorry that we do not have more specific details to show us the extent and gravity of the problem 
 declare adjourned the session of the european parliament 
mr president  am going to speak on the report by mrs poli bortone 
mr president  would like firstly to highlight the efforts made by the committee on agriculture and rural development in order to be able to reach an agreement amongst all of the political groups which is not at all easy given that the commissions initial proposal was aimed more towards the disappearance of sugar cultivation than its reform without taking account of the resulting social cost 
mr president  would point out to mr kusstatscher that prevention and protection  not in peoples leisure activities but in their workplaces  is a matter of concern to us too but if the commission and the council have their way it is evident that building firms will in future have to certify that ultraviolet rays are safe for those of their workers who work in the open air 
mr president by taking the floor in the debate on the regulations on structural fund spending  would like to draw your attention to three serious omissions relating to the matter 
mr president ladies and gentlemen clearly the european commission is endeavouring with its proposal to strike a balance between the increased financing requirements of enlargement and the difficulties of the shortterm economy and the options of the strong member states 
mr president on world  day  would like to begin as other members have done by alerting the institutions to the most dramatic aspect of this tragedy its spread amongst women and girls 
mr president the main virtue of the report by mr miller is that it attempts a global approach

mr president lithuania has been a member of the european union since  which means that it should comply with the legal obligations arising under community legislation 
 mr president ladies and gentlemen not only did the attack in madrid kill many people but it also undermined the sovereignty of a european state
